# PayScan HR — IT Department HR Admin Dashboard

A mini Human Resource admin dashboard for managing employees, payments, and activity tracking.  
This project integrates both **software and hardware** components including employee QR card scanning with Arduino for salary payment confirmation.

---

## Features

- Employee management with roles (Teacher, Professor, Staff, etc.)
- Payment tracking and status
- QR code scanning integration via Arduino hardware
- React + Vite frontend using Flowbite React UI components
- Express.js backend API
- PostgreSQL database managed with Prisma ORM
- Environment variable management with `.env` files

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Flowbite React
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma
- Hardware: Arduino UNO with QR scanner and LCD display
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + Flowbite

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- PostgreSQL database
- Arduino IDE (for hardware programming)

---

### Installation

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eaintthettun/pay-scan-hr.git
   cd pay-scan-hr
   ```
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables (example):

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/pay_db"
   PORT=4000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Set up your PostgreSQL database and run Prisma migrations:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

5. Start the development servers:

   - Backend (Express API):

     ```bash
     npm run dev:server
     ```

   - Frontend (Vite React app):

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

---

## Prisma Setup

- The Prisma schema is located in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- It defines the `Employee`, `Payment`, and other related models.
- Use Prisma Client to query and manage your database records in backend routes.

---

## Environment Variables (`.env`)

Use the `.env` file to keep sensitive data like database URLs, JWT secrets, API keys, and ports.
Make sure **not to commit** this file to public repositories.

Example variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="your_postgres_connection_string"
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET="your_secret_key"
```

---

## Hardware Integration

- Arduino UNO reads employee QR codes via a scanner.
- The scanned code is sent to the backend API to verify salary payment status.
- Arduino displays payment success or already paid message on an LCD.
- This project uses serial communication between Arduino and backend.

## Folder Structure

```
/backend         # Express API server with Prisma integration
/frontend        # React + Vite + Flowbite React dashboard
/prisma          # Prisma schema and migrations
/hardware        # Arduino source code for QR scanning and LCD display
```

---

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start frontend dev server
- `npm run dev:server` — Start backend Express server
- `npx prisma migrate dev` — Run Prisma migrations
- `npx prisma generate` — Generate Prisma client
